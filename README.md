TIØ4550 - Investering, finans og økonomistyring, fordypningsprosjekt

This is our source code for the project thesis in TIØ4550. The code is used to run Monte Carlo simultions to estimate TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) for BETs and DTs. 

To run the simulations, go to the file run_simulations.py. 
From there, comment out the monte carlo simulations and histograms you don't want to include, and run the file.
